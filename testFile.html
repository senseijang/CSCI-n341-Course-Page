    <!-- This <title> displays in the page tab -->
    <title>testFile</title>

    <!-- This will link to your CSS stylesheet for formatting as soon as you create the file. The page will work without it, though. -->

    <!-- This links to the jQuery library so your js code will work 
         Always include this *before* your own js code (extremely important) -->
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <!-- This links to the js code specific for this page -->

      Webpages are fun to work with especially if you have cool JavaScript to
